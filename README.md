# About #
The purpose of this repository is to make the HTML5 source for
[EventArgs](http://5.eventargs.com/ "5.EventArgs") available. The site is simply
a sandbox to test out what kind of things HTML5 and CSS3 can do and how these
technologies may be leveraged to build rich web apps.

# Build Instructions #
From [HTML5 Boiler Plate](http://html5boilerplate.com/docs/Build-script/ "HTML5 Boiler Plate")

Builds will be pushed to the publish directory.

## Mac Users ##
Open the application Terminal and navigate to the build directory. Type the
command [ant build].

#Windows users#
- Get the Java JDK (JRE isn't enough)
- Get WinAnt and point the installer to [Program Files/Java/jre6/bin/]

Open command line interface by doing Start Menu > Run > cmd.exe and run the
command [ant build] or launch the runbuildscript.bat file.
